Chinese immigrants first arrived in Oakland in the 1850s. In the 1870s, local exclusion laws forced Chinese people to move to the current location of the Oakland Chinatown neighborhood, centered at 8th Street and Webster Street. Today, Oakland Chinatown is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Oakland with people that trace their roots to China, Vietnam, Korea, Philippines, Japan, Cambodia, Laos, Laotian, Thailand, and Samoa. It is also one of the most transit-accessible neighborhoods in Oakland with Lake Merritt and 12th Street BART and several major bus lines that connect it to the rest of Oakland, and the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is fun and lively with people coming and going at almost all hours of the day.  Turn your head in any direction and you will find a place to enjoy a yummy meal or tasty tea. The restaurants in Oakland Chinatown are mouth-wateringly good and have authentic family vibes. Hot tea, or cold. Boba or traditional. Oakland Chinatown is the spot to meet up with your friends to share a drink. Friendly, market vibes make you want to lose yourself in the colorful produce that lines the sidewalk. Eclectic, curious vibes draw you into local shops that carry everything from healing herbs to porcelain figurines. Oakland Chinatown is one of the most important cultural centers of Oakland with public parks, libraries, schools, and the Oakland Museum all located within this walkable neighborhood.</p>\n",map:{address:"Jackson St, Oakland, CA 94607, USA",lat:37.797883489755385,lng:-122.26782583942565,zoom:16,place_id:"ChIJXxIQ8MqAj4ARwUfUEJOVnAo",city:"Oakland",state:"California",state_short:"CA",post_code:"94607",country:"United States",country_short:"US"},vibes:[{},{},{},{}]},map:{lat:37.797883489755385,lng:-122.26782583942565,zoom:16},radius:"0.1",name:"Chinatown",location:{latitude:37.797883489755385,longitude:-122.26782583942565,zoom:16}},{slug:"city-park",vibe:[],acf:{city:[{ID:38380,post_name:"denver",post_title:"Denver",post_type:"city"}],photos:[{ID:45783,title:"Bluebird Theater in City Park Denver",filename:"Bluebird-Theater-in-City-Park-Denver.jpeg",url:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bluebird-Theater-in-City-Park-Denver.jpeg",caption:"Bluebird Theater in City Park Denver.

Thought provoking murals peaking around almost every corner, the smell of malt wafting out of brewery doors, and restaurants with outdoor patios sparkling with lights and the laughter of people having a good time are what define the vibe of this part of Oakland. </span></p>\n',map:{address:"Jack London Square, Water Street, Oakland, CA, USA",lat:37.79506910000001,lng:-122.2777955,zoom:14,place_id:"ChIJh4bticiAj4ARWq51mwQd95E",name:"Jack London Square",street_number:"472",street_name:"Water Street",street_name_short:"Water St",city:"Oakland",state:"California",state_short:"CA",post_code:"94607",country:"United States",country_short:"US"},vibes:[{},{},{},{}]},map:{lat:37.79506910000001,lng:-122.2777955,zoom:14},radius:"0.3",name:"Jack London",location:{latitude:37.79506910000001,longitude:-122.2777955,zoom:14}},{slug:"monraz-guadalajara",vibe:[1106,2162,2119],acf:{city:[{ID:1450,post_name:"guadalajara",post_title:"Guadalajara",post_type:"city"}],photos:[{ID:37155,title:"_MG_3977",filename:"MG_3977.jpg",url:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg",caption:"",date:"2022-01-30 08:49:57",sizes:{thumbnail:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","thumbnail-width":128,"thumbnail-height":85,medium:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","medium-width":800,"medium-height":533,medium_large:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":512,large:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","large-width":800,"large-height":533,"1536x1536":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","1536x1536-width":800,"1536x1536-height":533,"2048x2048":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","2048x2048-width":800,"2048x2048-height":533,"4K":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","4K-width":800,"4K-height":533,"1440p":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","1440p-width":800,"1440p-height":533,"1080p":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","1080p-width":800,"1080p-height":533,"720p":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","720p-width":800,"720p-height":533,"480p":"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MG_3977.jpg","480p-width":640,"480p-height":426},alt:"",description:""}],description:"<p>As Monráz and Juan Manuel neighborhoods are near the Providencia area, you can find some similarities as they share the same fashion and are full of wonder.

A mix of local activists, business owners, and artists have reinvented this neighborhood from marginalized and left behind, into the heart and soul of Oakland. Now, in KONO you can find art galleries, boutiques, breweries, craft cocktails, tasty food and ice cream at almost all hour of the day or night. While the edges of the neighborhood are fuzzy and changing from month to month, if you are on Broadway or Telegraph Avenue between Grand Avenue and 27th Stret you have arrived. Its easy to get there too, take BART to 19th Street exit and then head north.</p>\n<p>The vibe is eclectic, creative and fun. The Hive is always a great place to grab a coffee or ice cream. Beer gardens dot the neighborhood making it a perfect place to explore the beers of Oakland. Yummy food is everywhere. Sit down restaurants, slices to go, late night bites, and of course hot dog carts. The neighborhood pulses with activity from the live music venues that surround it &#8211; The Fox Theater, The Paramount, Starline Social Club, and The New Parish. And if you want to see KONO at it’s most authentic, make sure to be here during Oakland First Fridays. It’s one of the vibiest street festivals West of the Mississippi. And First Fridays brings together thousands of joyous folks to absorb art, eat street food, dance to live music and enjoy the Oakland vibes. KONO is a classic downtown neighborhood that embodies that energy and spirit of Oakland’s past, present, and future.</p>\n",map:{address:"526 Thomas L Berkley Way, Oakland, CA 94612, USA",lat:37.809589965684175,lng:-122.26953311691895,zoom:16,place_id:"ChIJm-GubZOHj4ARB8G_gXuphBA",street_number:"526",street_name:"Thomas L Berkley Way",city:"Oakland",state:"California",state_short:"CA",post_code:"94612",country:"United States",country_short:"US"},vibes:[{},{},{},{},{}]},map:{lat:37.809589965684175,lng:-122.26953311691895,zoom:16},radius:"0.4",name:"Koreatown Northgate",location:{latitude:37.809589965684175,longitude:-122.26953311691895,zoom:16}}],badges=[{slug:"downtown-portland-summer-challenge",status:"publish",vibe:[],badge_family:[],key:"downtown-portland-summer-challenge",description:"<p>Unlock prizes and embrace local adventures while you explore Downtown Portland this summer.</p>\n",has_location:!0,map:{address:"Downtown Portland, Portland, OR, USA",lat:45.5173454,lng:-122.6835562,city:"Portland",name:"Portland Downtown",zoom:14},icon:{url:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vibemap_City_Portland-17.jpg",icon:"https://vibemap.wpengine.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png"},name:"Downtown Portland Summer Challenge",location:{ID:1441,post_title:"Portland",post_name:"portland"}},{slug:"downtown-oakland-summer-challenge",status:"publish",vibe:[],badge_family:[],key:"downtown-oakland-summer-challenge",description:"<p>Unlock prizes and embrace local adventures while you explore Downtown Oakland this summer.
