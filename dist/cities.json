    "description": "Located only fifteen miles north of Peoria is historic Chillicothe, where the rails cross the river. This town grew from its river traffic and ideal location for railroad transportation. The flourishing downtown business district is classic Main Street USA playing home to boutiques, restaurants, barbershops and the Town Theater. \r\n\r\nChillicothe’s Town Theatre is located in a reclaimed opera house dating back to 1920. After the opera house suffered a catastrophic fire in 1922, the site sat empty until 1926 when it was purchased and reopened as the Sunset Theatre in 1927. After several incarnations and another fire in 1982, the theater is now owned by the Chillicothe Optimist Club. Most notable in this river town is the yearly Summer Camp Music Festival. This multi-day music festival at Three Sisters Park brings more than 30,000 visitors to the town of 6,000 residents every Memorial Day Weekend.\r\n\r\nDon't miss Illinois Made maker Triple Dipple's in downtown, where you are encouraged to \"eat dessert first!\"",

    "description": "On your way out of Peoria County, you’ll run across Tanner’s Orchard, located in Speer on the border of Peoria and Stark Counties. Since 1947, four generations of the Tanner family have welcomed people from all over to an amazing farm experience. This 80-acre farm has become a family destination with a bakery serving noon lunches, a large country farm market with the best apple cider donuts you will ever taste, pick your own apples and pumpkins, a corn maze and the Back 40 Fun Acres with farm animals. \r\n\r\nStretching through Stark County is Rock Island Trail, a 26-mile long public rail trail filled with prairie grasses, beautiful views and uninterrupted nature. The trail is used for a number of recreational activities including hiking, biking, camping and skiing. Bring your family out for a day on the trail and enjoy the beauty of nature. Just north of Peoria on Rt. 40 also in Stark County, you’ll discover the historic Pony Truss Steel Bridge, a perfect spot to stretch your legs and enjoy the views.\r\n\r\nFarther north in Wyoming sits the beautifully restored Paramount Theater. Originally opened in 1934, this theater has closed and reopened multiple times throughout its history. Now, this old-school theatre hosts events year-round and is a performance venue bringing culture alive to Stark County. Toulon is where Stark County’s Courthouse and Jail is located, and it is the oldest operating courthouse in the state of Illinois. Built back in 1857, the courthouse has been renovated throughout the years but the original structure remains the same. Discover the rich history of Stark County when you visit the Stark County Historical Society, built in 1847 and documented in the Library of Congress. Abraham Lincoln once spoke here during a Senate campaign in 1858, to enthusiastic crowds in Toulon.\r\n\r\nAlso in Wyoming is A Few of My Favorite Things gift shop. This specialty store is a fun stop if you're in the area and in the mood for some shopping, and sells beautiful flowers as well as many specialty gift items. \r\n\r\nAfter a day in Stark County, head out to Catalpa Grove for tasty burgers, steaks, pasta, chicken, wraps, tacos and more. Catalpa Grove is a delicious bar and grill serving up American food that the whole family will enjoy. Their huge menu ensures you’ll find something you love, try out the hamburger horseshoe or the fried calamari and don’t forget to ask for one of their special sauces!",
