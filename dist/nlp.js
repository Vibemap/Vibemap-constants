Wikipedia describes it as a small, unglamorous, eclectic, and old-style bar. Some say the line between a dive bar and a regular bar is its level of disrepute. For this guide, we define it as a place with three things: cheap drinks, chill vibes, and an unpretentious atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><p>Chances are high you‚Äôre not going to get your culinary socks knocked off at a dive bar.
